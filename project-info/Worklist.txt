Almost ready for first release! :)
A few more things before Editor4J 1.0 rolls out:

- Automatic Syntax Highlighter detection by file extension, e.g SYNTAX_STYLE_RUBY for .rb files
- Saved / Not Saved indicator (title bar?)
- SettingsDialog gui polishing, (it looks really unfinished)
- Restore to defaults button in SettingsDialog
- Editor wide font application
