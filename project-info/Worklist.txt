Almost ready for first release! :)
A few more things before Editor4J 1.0 rolls out:

- Move Load/Save file code to SwingWorker and off EDT (done as offEDT() versions of methods, but still need testing)
- Developer Mode, add a dashboard which shows developer options, enabled in Settings
- Lower Settings Dialog loading time (maybe due to JFontBox)
- Line wrap is not really line wrap it's word wrap
