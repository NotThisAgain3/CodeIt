Almost ready for first release! :)
A few more things before Editor4J 1.0 rolls out:

- Move to a new Build System (done, Gradle)
- Abstract GUI building into a new class (done, Editor.java)
- Saving and Reloading User Settings (fixed, Pulled RSTA source and made necessary changes)

- Next Work Items will be added after Maintenance Mode

- Pull RSTA source and make Theme.java, SyntaxStyle.java and Style.java serializable
(I didn't back that up after moving from Mint to Zorin), then figure out how to integrate
it with E4J. CI in a seperate repo? Stick sources directly into E4J sources?

Bugs:
- Font saving is a little buggy, apply needs to be pressed twice, first time RSTA goes to it's default font, second
time RSTA applies selected font

Notes:
- The GUI Architecture is getting kind of weird, look for new ones?
- Next Weekend Oct 16-17 will be maintenance mode, E4J needs a big refactor and
needs to iron out the bugs
